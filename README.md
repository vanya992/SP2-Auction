# Semester Project 2: Auction site / Prestige Auctions

## About this project:

This is a school project that I have made, with API provided for the auction site. This should have been a thorough application of the knowledge we have gathered so far.

Brief has stated which user stories we have to cover: 
  - A user with a stud.noroff.no email may register
  - A registered user may login
  - A registered user may logout
  - A registered user may update their avatar
  - A registered user may view their total credit
  - A registered user may create a Listing with a title, deadline date, media gallery and description  - 
  - A registered user may add a Bid to another userâ€™s Listing
  - A registered user may view Bids made on a Listing
  - An unregistered user may search through Listings

To plan this project I have used Trello board, and I have upgraded my Trello account so that I can make Gantt chart from it, so here you can check on the plan:

Design was made in Figma. Here is the prototype that was my plan, and I think I did a good job sticking to it: https://www.figma.com/file/gLnXOfnI4RwqZnrzJw0P6B/Untitled?type=design&node-id=70%3A200&mode=design&t=R4cyOgcy2qxRBTa3-1

I have made some crutial changes, when I realised that only I had idea with the jewelry, and no one else has been interested in posting it.

In Canva I have made style guide: https://www.canva.com/design/DAF3xgHENKY/fgWLTVcc1KF1xDJKqD90jQ/view?utm_content=DAF3xgHENKY&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=editor

When almost finished, site was hosted on Netlify platform, and here is the link to check it: https://prestigeauctions.netlify.app

This was very chalenging project for me. I was in a fight with time to make the best practice out of it and to actually work, but I did the best I was able at the moment.

As always, designing is my worst nightmare, but I think as time passes I am also getting a bit better in it.

Project that I am delivering has checked all of the necessarities, and I had no time to do more, but I would be happy to come back to it when time comes to my side.
